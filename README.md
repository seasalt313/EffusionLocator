Hello!

I created this web page, as a tool for the potential clients of AirParfum technologies. Our group has created a "experience locator" where customers can find an Effusion machine,so that they might sample perfumes. I included relevant assets, modified the designs, and content, to create this web page. 

I wanted a simple, responsive page, that created a parallax effect. JS was not needed so much, and is basically used to create a responsive page with jquery. I wanted a one pager, with a JUMP LINK to the brands, for all customers to see.
